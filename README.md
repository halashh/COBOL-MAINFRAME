Personal Notes:

Computer architecture:
Components:
-Instructor Set Procedure.
-Datapath and Control.
-Digital Design.
-Circuit Design.
-Physical Design.

In mainframe de aux storage o OWC is in DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) the last mention are HardDisk or SolidDisk.

OS:
Status:
-NEW: process is in building stage.
-READY: its ready, but the CPU its busy execution any else.
-RUNNIG: in process. Executing.
-WAIT: depends on another action to be executed.
-TERMINATED: the actions/executions was ends.

OS functions:
1. Process Management
2. Security Management
3. File Management
4. Communications Management
5. Resource Management
6. Memory Management

Mainframe Operating Systems:
-z/OS: It can execute many types of jobs/tasks on the same time.

-Z/TPF: Use in companies that needs execute transactions in real time.

-z/VM: Its a virtual workspace, necessary to develop and test.

-z/VSE: Its a copy of z/OS but with less resources than z/OS.

-Linux on IBM Z: Using on phones, console videogames, watches, etc.

-KVM on Z: Hipervisor opensource.
